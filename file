**Title: How I Hacked the Learning System**

Recently, a friend was shocked: "How did you, a C# web dev, build a mobile app in Java in a single day and make $200, even though you had zero experience with mobile?"

The answer is simple: I stopped listening to "experts" and their analogies. You know those attempts to explain, for example, client-server interaction using the restaurant analogy? Like, you're the client, you place an order (request) with the waiter (network), the kitchen (server) prepares it and sends back the dish (response). But honestly, that's complete bullshit. Instead of making things easier, these analogies just dump a whole unnecessary system on youâ€”the restaurantâ€”and make everything ten times more complicated. You start getting bogged down in the details of this restaurant scenario: "Can you tip the waiter, or ask for a complaints book or something? ðŸ˜‚". These analogies don't just fail to simplifyâ€”they actively get in the way, forcing you to waste time matching up things that have nothing in common and creating false ideas. While you're busy wrestling with this crap, trying to stretch a broken analogy over a real technical concept, you could have already understood everything if someone just explained it to you as it is. In the end, instead of clarity, you get a mess in your head. For me, these analogies just made me feel even dumber, like an idiot who can't grasp "simple" things.

I realized I needed a different approachâ€”just getting straight to the point, with no extra fluff. And I found a way to get that when I started using AI, but with a very specific demand in our "dialogue."

My breakthrough happened when I started demanding something different from AI. My prompt goes something like: "Listen, AI, forget the analogies. Completely. Explain [complex concept] to me as if I'm dumb as fuck. But stick to the point, no metaphors, and don't try to dumb it down to some childish fairy tale."
And, surprise! As soon as AI stops trying to be a "creative teacher" and just tells it like it is, in the simplest, most direct words possible, even the most mind-bending topics become clear. If I still don't get it, I just say: "Nope, still not getting it. Even simpler. But stick to the pointâ€”no new analogies or kiddie explanations."

That's my key. Directness. Demanding explanations "for the clinically dumb," but to the point. And it works. Complex things become clear.

Stop pretending analogies help everyone. Who has actually managed to understand something truly complex thanks to them, instead of just getting the illusion of understanding? Share if you have a different experience (though I seriously doubt it).
